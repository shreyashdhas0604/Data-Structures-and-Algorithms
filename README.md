# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms. It aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding and applying fundamental and advanced computer science concepts.

Here, you'll find clear code examples covering topics such as:
- **Arrays and Strings:** Basic operations and manipulation techniques.
- **Linked Lists:** Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Trees and Graphs:** Binary trees, binary search trees, traversal methods, and graph algorithms.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Common algorithms including quick sort, merge sort, binary search, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms:** Solutions to classic problems using efficient approaches.

Each implementation is designed to be modular and educational, making it a great reference for both learning and enhancing your coding projects.

Happy coding and exploring!
